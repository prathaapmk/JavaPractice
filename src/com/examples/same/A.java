/**
 * The {@code A} class represents character strings. All
 * string literals in Java programs, such as {@code "abc"}, are
 * implemented as instances of this class.
 * <p>
 * Strings are constant; their values cannot be changed after they
 * are created. String buffers support mutable strings.
 * Because String objects are immutable they can be shared. For example:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     String str = "abc";
 * </pre></blockquote><p>
 * is equivalent to:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     char data[] = {'a', 'b', 'c'};
 *     String str = new String(data);
 * </pre></blockquote><p>
 * Here are some more examples of how strings can be used:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     System.out.println("abc");
 *     String cde = "cde";
 *     System.out.println("abc" + cde);
 *     String c = "abc".substring(2, 3);
 *     String d = cde.substring(1, 2);
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * <p>
 * The class {@code String} includes methods for examining
 * individual characters of the sequence, for comparing strings, for
 * searching strings, for extracting substrings, and for creating a
 * copy of a string with all characters translated to uppercase or to
 * lowercase. Case mapping is based on the Unicode Standard version
 * specified by the {@link java.lang.Character Character} class.
 * <p>
 * The Java language provides special support for the string
 * concatenation operator (&nbsp;+&nbsp;), and for conversion of
 * other objects to strings. For additional information on string
 * concatenation and conversion, see <i>The Java Language Specification</i>.
 *
 * <p> Unless otherwise noted, passing a {@code null} argument to a constructor
 * or method in this class will cause a {@link NullPointerException} to be
 * thrown.
 *
 * <p>A {@code String} represents a string in the UTF-16 format
 * in which <em>supplementary characters</em> are represented by <em>surrogate
 * pairs</em> (see the section <a href="Character.html#unicode">Unicode
 * Character Representations</a> in the {@code Character} class for
 * more information).
 * Index values refer to {@code char} code units, so a supplementary
 * character uses two positions in a {@code String}.
 * <p>The {@code String} class provides methods for dealing with
 * Unicode code points (i.e., characters), in addition to those for
 * dealing with Unicode code units (i.e., {@code char} values).
 *
 * <p>Unless otherwise noted, methods for comparing Strings do not take locale
 * into account.  The {@link java.text.Collator} class provides methods for
 * finer-grain, locale-sensitive String comparison.
 *
 * @implNote The implementation of the string concatenation operator is left to
 * the discretion of a Java compiler, as long as the compiler ultimately conforms
 * to <i>The Java Language Specification</i>. For example, the {@code javac} compiler
 * may implement the operator with {@code StringBuffer}, {@code StringBuilder},
 * or {@code java.lang.invoke.StringConcatFactory} depending on the JDK version. The
 * implementation of string conversion is typically through the method {@code toString},
 * defined by {@code Object} and inherited by all classes in Java.
